# Find-Movie-Similarity-from-Plot-Summaries
 This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is an exciting field of study in data science where algorithms are used to make sense out of conversational language. We implement this to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots provided on IMDb and Wikipedia.

 The dataset we use contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb, as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
